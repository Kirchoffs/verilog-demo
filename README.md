## Structural & Behavioral Representation
In Verilog HDL, there are two main ways to represent a digital circuit: structural and behavioral.

Structural representation describes the circuit in terms of its physical components, such as gates, flip-flops, and other modules. The structural code specifies how these components are connected together to form a larger circuit. This type of representation is often used to describe circuits that are already well understood and have a fixed structure, such as adders or multiplexers.

Behavioral representation, on the other hand, describes the circuit in terms of its behavior, or the way it operates. This type of code focuses on the input/output behavior of the circuit, without specifying the internal components that make it up. Behavioral representation is often used when the circuit is complex and the internal structure is less important.

In practice, most digital circuits are designed using a combination of both structural and behavioral representations. The choice of representation depends on the specific requirements of the circuit, as well as the design style and preferences of the designer.
